# Code Reflection

## Can I explain what my code does?
My code creates a HTML resume webpage with multiple sections

## What was my coding process?
I started by setting up the basic HTML structure and then added content section by section 

## What challenges did I have?
I encountered validation errors related to improper nesting of elements and missing required attributes, which took time to identify and correct.

## What would I do differently now?
If I were to start over, I would regularly validate my HTML throughout the development process rather than only at the end, catching errors early when they're easier to fix.
